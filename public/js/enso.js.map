`parse` functions.\n *\n * @description\n * Build `formatLong` property for locale used by `format`, `formatRelative` and `parse` functions.\n * Returns a function which takes one of the following tokens as the argument:\n * `'LTS'`, `'LT'`, `'L'`, `'LL'`, `'LLL'`, `'l'`, `'ll'`, `'lll'`, `'llll'`\n * and returns a long format string written as `format` token strings.\n * See [format]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/format}\n *\n * `'l'`, `'ll'`, `'lll'` and `'llll'` formats are built automatically\n * by shortening some of the tokens from corresponding unshortened formats\n * (e.g., if `LL` is `'MMMM DD YYYY'` then `ll` will be `MMM D YYYY`)\n *\n * @param {Object} obj - the object with long formats written as `format` token strings\n * @param {String} obj.LT - time format: hours and minutes\n * @param {String} obj.LTS - time format: hours, minutes and seconds\n * @param {String} obj.L - short date format: numeric day, month and year\n * @param {String} [obj.l] - short date format: numeric day, month and year (shortened)\n * @param {String} obj.LL - long date format: day, month in words, and year\n * @param {String} [obj.ll] - long date format: day, month in words, and year (shortened)\n * @param {String} obj.LLL - long date and time format\n * @param {String} [obj.lll] - long date and time format (shortened)\n * @param {String} obj.LLLL - long date, time and weekday format\n * @param {String} [obj.llll] - long date, time and weekday format (shortened)\n * @returns {Function} `formatLong` property of the locale\n *\n * @example\n * // For `en-US` locale:\n * locale.formatLong = buildFormatLongFn({\n *   LT: 'h:mm aa',\n *   LTS: 'h:mm:ss aa',\n *   L: 'MM/DD/YYYY',\n *   LL: 'MMMM D YYYY',\n *   LLL: 'MMMM D YYYY h:mm aa',\n *   LLLL: 'dddd, MMMM D YYYY
